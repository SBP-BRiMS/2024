						<h3>Wednesday, September 20, 2023 <small>5:00pm - 6:00pm</small> In-Person</h3>
						<h2>Nathaniel Persily </h2>
						<h3><small>Professor at Stanford Law School</small> </h3>
						<p>Nathaniel Persily is the James B. McClatchy Professor of Law at Stanford Law School, with appointments in the departments of Political Science, Communication, and FSI.  Prior to joining Stanford, Professor Persily taught at Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania Law School, and as a visiting professor at Harvard, NYU, Princeton, the University of Amsterdam, and the University of Melbourne. Professor Persily’s scholarship and legal practice focus on American election law or what is sometimes called the “law of democracy,” which addresses issues such as voting rights, political parties, campaign finance, redistricting, and election administration. He has served as a special master or court-appointed expert to craft congressional or legislative districting plans for Georgia, Maryland, Connecticut, New York, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.  He also served as the Senior Research Director for the Presidential Commission on Election Administration. In addition to dozens of articles (many of which have been cited by the Supreme Court) on the legal regulation of political parties, issues surrounding the census and redistricting process, voting rights, and campaign finance reform, Professor Persily is coauthor of the leading election law casebook, The Law of Democracy (Foundation Press, 5th ed., 2016), with Samuel Issacharoff, Pamela Karlan, and Richard Pildes. His current work, for which he has been honored as a Guggenheim Fellow, Andrew Carnegie Fellow, and a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, examines the impact of changing technology on political communication, campaigns, and election administration.  He is codirector of the Stanford Cyber Policy Center, Stanford Program on Democracy and the Internet, and the Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project, which supported local election officials in taking the necessary steps during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide safe voting options for the 2020 election. He is also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a commissioner on the Kofi Annan Commission on Elections and Democracy in the Digital Age.  He received a B.A. and M.A. in political science from Yale (1992); a J.D. from Stanford (1998) where he was President of the Stanford Law Review, and a Ph.D. in political science from U.C. Berkeley in 2002.

						<h3>Talk title: "Democracy and Elections in the Age of AI"</h3>
						
						<!--<p>Abstract: Governments exists to support the sovereignty of its nation - its borders and people.  Decisions by the government on behalf of the populace should be made with the "best" interest in meeting their populace's needs.  What are these needs?  What will keep them happy?   In this presentation we will provide motivation as to the need for answers and take a walk through a series of research activities that were pursued to explore such questions.  We conclude by discussing the need for continued research, the motivation for SBP and its importance to the community.</p>-->

						<h3>Talk title: "Challenges in Modeling the COVID-19 Pandemic and Behavior"</h3>
						<!--<p>Abstract:  It has been nearly 30 years since the first BRIMS meeting and more than a dozen years since the first SBP meeting in 2008. While much has changed since then to advance the field, some things remain disappointingly the same – and need to be addressed. Even so, the future for behavioral-social modeling and simulation (B-S M&S) is quite bright with a multitude of exciting opportunities just around the corner. After briefly reflecting on the progress made in behavioral representation in modeling and simulation, Dr. Mabry will share her thoughts on what recent events tell us about the future of the field, how we can prepare for it, and even shape it. As an interdisciplinary scientist who has spent over a decade of her career leading the systems science program out of the Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research at the (National Institutes of Health), and has been a researcher in small business, academia and a now in a health care system, Dr. Mabry has a unique multidimensional perspective on the value of B-S M&S and its applications. In this talk, she will identify opportunities and caveats for B-S M&S while challenging the audience to engage in self-reflection and critical thinking about how we can collaboratively take on the most pressing problems of our times. Dr. Mabry will share her optimistic vision of the future of B-S M&S and explain how a wide range of influences lead her to this deduction. Those influences include external events such as the rise of Artificial Intelligence, the COVID-19 pandemic, the quest for precision medicine, issues and opportunities in data and technology. She will also explain her passion for using B-S M&S methods to engage in the science of science, the need for cross-disciplinary collaboration, and suggest ways to foster a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion in the field.</p>-->
