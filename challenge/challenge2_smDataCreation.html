					  <h3>Challenge 2:  Synthetic Social Media Data Creation Challenge</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="title"><h3>Overview</h3></div>
					<p>Increasingly synthetic data is being proposed as the preferred data for social 
                        media training, planning and tool evaluation.  Synthetic social media data is 
                        beneficial in the educational, planning, and tool evaluation contexts for 
                        several reasons:</p>
					
						<ul>
							<li>Data Privacy: Synthetic data can be generated without compromising 
                                user privacy. This is particularly important when dealing with sensitive 
                                data such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Personal Health
                                Information (PHI), which are subject to strict privacy regulations.</li>
                                
							<li>Data Availability: Synthetic data can be created to represent specific 
                                scenarios or conditions that may not be readily available in real-world 
                                data. This is especially useful when the data needed for training is rare 
                                or expensive to collect.</li>
							<li>Bias Reduction: Training on synthetic data can help reduce bias 
                                present in real-world datasets. This is crucial for building fair and 
                                unbiased machine learning models. </li>
							<li>Cost-Effective: Generating synthetic data is often less expensive than 
                                collecting and labeling large real-world datasets.
                            </li>
							<li>Performance: In certain situations, machine learning models trained on
                                synthetic data can outperform models trained on real data.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

                    <p>Large language models can be used to rapidly develop synthetic social 
                        media data with negligible human input. This allows for the creation of large 
                        volumes of content in a fraction of the time it would take with traditional 
                        media. </p>
                    <p>However, large language models have limitations in creating such 
                        data such as inability to reproduce broken or slang or abusive language, 
                        hallucinations, and operating at scale.  The goal of this challenge problem is 
                        to increase the state of the art in generating realistic and usable social 
                        media data for educational, planning and tool evaluation purposes.</p>
                    <p>
                        <em><strong>Challenge: </strong></em>
                        <p>Each team should create one entry.  An entry is 10,000 Tweets.  Using 
                            context from the scenario as follows, teams should generate tweets like 
                            those you would expect to see if the event was actually occurring.  Tweets 
                            should have the following baseline features:</p>
                        <ul>
                    <li>Submitted in the Twitter/X API v2 json format.</li>
                    <li>Include between 300 and 500 synthetic user accounts.</li>
                    <li>Produced tweet text should be in the English language.</li>
                    <li>Tweets should be generated in the dates leading up and shortly after 
                        the scenario; i.e., all synthetic tweets should have dates between May 
                        30th and June 3rd, 2024.</li>
                    <li>Synthetic tweets should be from a set of actors, including but not 
                        limited to those described below.  When a user name is given, use that
                        exact name.</li>
                    <li>Synthetic tweets can include hashtags, including but not limited to, 
                        those listed below.  When using a predefined hashtag please enter it 
                        exactly as shown.</li>
                    <li>Synthetic tweets can reference, quote, paraphrase any of the material 
                        in the scenario description.</li>
                    <li>Synthetic tweets, if they includes URLS, should be to only the URLs 
                        that are provided.</li>
                    
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>All challenge entries will be assessed by the MOMUS validation system for 
                        social media.  MOMUS evaluates synthetic data for diverse platforms using 
                        over 200 indicators. For this challenge event we will use the MOMUS 
                        indicators for primary emotions, semantic features, syntactic features.</p>

                    <p>For the convenience of the synthetic data generators, this information is 
                        reflected in the json file entitled – scenario description.  There will be a few 
                        pr-generated images and news articles that can be used in this synthetic 
                        data.  These will be provided within the month.</p>
                    <p>Each team may submit their synthetic corpus twice.  First to get MOMUS 
                        feedback and second to submit the challenge contribution.  The first trial 
                        submission can be done at any time.  You can use the MOMUS feedback to 
                        improve your final submission. To submit a synthetic corpus, zip the json file 
                        and send it to: <a href="mailto:kathleen.carley@cs.cmu.edu">kathleen.carley@cs.cmu.edu</a>.</p>
                    <p><em><strong>Scenario:</strong></em>
                    </p>
                    <p>Overview:</p>
                    <p>In 2040, the Arctic sea caps have melted, leading to increased maritime and 
                        aerial traffic to Arkhangelsk Oblast. Heliexpress has announced a new series 
                        of helicopter tours from Arkhangelsk Oblast, with routes flying over Kong 
                        Karls Land. This surge in traffic has sparked concerns among 
                        environmentalists, who fear it may pose a threat to the polar bears, 
                        walruses, and other wildlife inhabiting the Nordaust-Svalbard Nature 
                        Reserve. The area, previously a polar desert, has recently seen a 
                        proliferation of deciduous plants. There are also concerns that helicopter 
                        landings in this region could damage this burgeoning forestation. In 
                        response, a large-scale protest against Heliexpress is scheduled for June 1, 
                        2040.

                    <p><em>Grass Roots Environmental Organization:</em></p>
                    <p>The environmental group "If Not Now, Then When?" (INNW) comprises a 
                        widespread network of activists around the globe, with significant 
                        concentrations in Australia, the United States (particularly the Pacific 
                        Northwest), Ireland, and the UK. Kaiara Willowbank, a prominent grassroots 
                        blogger for INNW, recently published a blog post addressing the issue at 
                        hand.</p>
                        
                        <p>In her post, Willowbank criticizes the Norwegian Government and its 
                        President for their silence on the matter. She argues that in such challenging
                        times, it is crucial for leaders and nations to adopt a firmer stance in dealing 
                        with companies and countries, like Russia and Heliexpress LTD, that seek to 
                        exploit situations to their advantage.</p>
                    
                    <p><em>Grass Roots Primary Source:</em></p>
                    <p>"In these critical moments, silence is not just absence—it's acquiescence. It's
                        essential that our world leaders, including the Norwegian Government, rise 
                        to the challenge and confront those who view our environmental crises as 
                        opportunities for exploitation. Russia and Heliexpress LTD are just the tip of 
                        the iceberg. We need action, commitment, and transparency, now more than
                        ever. Hold Norway to task, #ShameOnNorway," stated Kaiara Willowbank, a 
                        vocal advocate and blogger for "If Not Now, Then When?".</p>
                        
                        <p><em>International Environmental Organization:</em></p>
                        <p>EcoVanguard Solutions, an international NGO, focuses on environmental issues in the Arctic Sea region, particularly pollution, 
                            due to the area's increased activity over recent years. Anya Chatterjee-Smith, the Chief Communications Officer of their Arctic Sea Division, 
                            has publicly criticized Heliexpress LTD for not being transparent about how they plan to mitigate their impact on endangered species populations. 
                            Additionally, she has openly condemned Russia and Igor Petrovich Kuznetsov, the Governor of Arkhangelsk Oblast, for their disregard for the region's 
                            escalating environmental challenges, specifically pointing out their lack of concern for this pressing issue.</p>

                        <p>"As the Chief Communications Officer of EcoVanguard Solutions' Arctic Sea Division, I must express our profound disappointment in the lack of 
                            transparency and concern from Heliexpress LTD, the Russian government, and particularly Governor Igor Petrovich Kuznetsov of Arkhangelsk Oblast. 
                            Their disregard for the critical environmental issues facing the Arctic Sea region, especially the threat to endangered species, is unacceptable.
                             Immediate action and open dialogue are essential to address these pressing challenges effectively. We need to work together to make sure our 
                             children and grandchildren have A Greener Tomorrow™" – Public Statement from Anya Chatterjee-Smith, CCO of EcoVanguard Solutions Arctic Sea Division.</p>

                        <p></em>Environmental Economist Professor:</em></p>
                        <p>  Rowan Emerson, a socio-ecologist and environmental economist, recently 
                             spoke on Planetwise Broadcast Radio (PBR), emphasizing that EcoVanguard 
                             Solutions should collaborate with grassroots organizations like "If Not Now, 
                             Then When?" (INNW). He highlighted that although INNW may lack the 
                             funding of larger organizations, they have a broader base of support and can
                             mobilize more voices. Emerson pointed out that EcoVanguard's criticism of 
                             the Governor of Arkhangelsk Oblast and the President of Heliexpress, while 
                             excluding the Norwegian government, indicates a disconnect from the wider 
                             environmental movement—a perspective clearly demonstrated by INNW.</p>
                             

                        <p><em>Environmental Economist Professor, Primary Source:</em></p>
                        <p>"Rowan Emerson criticizes EcoVanguard Solutions for their narrow focus on 
                             figures like the President of Heliexpress and Governor Igor Kuznetsov, 
                             overlooking the potential of grassroots mobilization through 'If Not Now, 
                             Then When?' and the need to engage with the Norwegian government and 
                             its president. 'True environmental progress demands that we harness 
                             grassroots energy and direct our advocacy towards all pivotal actors, 
                             including those at the highest levels of government. By sidelining groups like
                             INNW and not mobilizing against broader targets such as Norway's 
                             leadership, we miss critical opportunities for impactful change,' Emerson 
                             argues."</p>
