<div class="title"><h3>Overview</h3></div>
<p>As chatbots and other large language generators become more sophisticated they are increasingly
being used to handle a wide variety of tasks and to develop knowledge products such as news 
articles and creative arts. Society is striving to catch up with the implications of operationalizing 
these AI tools and to understand the risks associated with computationally generated 
information. In the domain of Cybersecurity, research questions arising from these advancements
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does this technology contribute to political polarization? How is polarization 
expressed in large language generators?</li>
<li>How does misinformation spread in chatbot knowledge production?</li>
<li>How are information and knowledge from language generators traced and attributed?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this year’s SBP-BriMS2023 challenge problem, we ask participants to consider the issue of 
polarized knowledge production</p>
<p>Choose one social or political issue, such as the cultural preferences of music (e.g., rap vs. 
classical music); the adoption of initially politically neutral new technology, e.g., electric 
vehicles, blockchain, or artificial intelligence tools; social issues, e.g., inequality and the pay gap,
vaccination, or sustainability; or political issues, e.g., elections or judicial ethics in the Supreme 
Court. Once you pick an issue, choose a large language generator such as those recently 
reviewed in <a href="https://writesonic.com/blog/chatgpt-alternatives/#socratic-by-google">https://writesonic.com/blog/chatgpt-alternatives/#socratic-by-google.</a></p>
<p>Develop two opposing sets of training questions for an English-speaking language generator and 
ask the chatbots to develop two 3,000-word articles, one for each side of the issue (or create a 
back-and-forth dialog that represents the polarized views). Analyze both the questions and the 
responses returned by the language generator.</p>
<p>Submit analysis of the output from the chatbot viewpoints on the social or political issue, a) 
show the semantic differences between the two sides and b) analyze how the two sets of training 
questions led to different chatbot behaviors. It may be necessary to prime the language generator 
to provide polarized information. How was this accomplished?</p>
		
                   <div class="title"><h3>Submitting an Entry</h3></div>
					<p><em><strong>What to Submit</strong></em></p>
					<p>You need to submit 2 things: a 2-pages extended abstract in conference format and a single 
PowerPoint teaser slide - that we can use to promote your entry. All two of these will go in the 
non-archival online proceedings.</p>
