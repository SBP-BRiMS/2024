					  <h3>Challenge 1 - Opioids</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="title"><h3>Overview</h3></div>
					<p>Opioids are a class of drugs that include illegal drugs (heroin), synthetic drug (e.g. fentanyl), and many pain relievers (e.g Vicodin®). These drugs are chemically related and interact with the opioid receptors on nerve cells in the body and brain.</p>
					<p>The US is facing an opioid crisis.  Deaths from opioids are increasing.  Opioid abuse is a serious public health issue. Today, overdose deaths are the leading cause of injury deaths in the US.</p>
					<p>Tempe, AZ, has provided data on <a href="https://www.govtech.com/health/Tempe-Ariz-Wastewater-Testing-Yields-Opioid-Crisis-Data.html">Probability-Normalized Mass Load of opioids in the wastewater</a> in the hopes that one may be able to use these data to infer opioid use patterns. Researchers with Arizona State University go at randomized times to 15 places in the city where they have access to wastewater. The locations of the testing are also randomized.Those researchers collect samples, taking them back to be processed for traces of materials with opioids. It is also continually updated, so you will need to state when the data was pulled. In parallel, they have released <a href="https://data.tempe.gov/showcase/opioid-abuse-probable-ems-call-dashboard">data on EMS calls for probable opioid abuse</a>. 
Both of these datasets are supposed to reflect underlying opioid abuse patterns.   </p>
					<p> Cincinnati has also released <a href="https://insights.cincinnati-oh.gov/stories/s/Heroin/dm3s-ep3u/">EMS calls for a single Opiod – Heroin - Cincinnati Heroin overdose data</a>. This data is comprised of the Cincinnati Fire Department responses to reported heroin overdose incidents, and does not include patient information or medical outcome data. It is continually updated, so you will need to state when the data was pulled. Geo-spatial information is provided.</p>

		    <!--<p>We invite participants to explore the online repository for heroin overdoses in Cincinnati Ohio. The data is at https://insights.cincinnati-oh.gov/stories/s/Heroin/dm3s-ep3u/. This data is comprised of the Cincinnati Fire Department responses to reported heroin overdose incidents, and does not include patient information or medical outcome data. It is continually updated, so you will need to state when the data was pulled. Geo-spatial information is provided.</p>
			
		    <p>We also invite participants to explore the online repository for wastewater opioid testing in Tempe Arizona. The data is at  https://www.govtech.com/health/Tempe-Ariz-Wastewater-Testing-Yields-Opioid-Crisis-Data.html. Researchers with Arizona State University go at randomized times to 15 places in the city where they have access to wastewater. The locations of the testing are also randomized.Those researchers collect samples, taking them back to be processed for traces of materials with opioids. It is also continually updated, so you will need to state when the data was pulled.</p>					    
		    
			<p>The questions to address in this challenge are:</p>
			<p>Do the two Tempe data sets tell the same story? Or Do the Tempe and the Cincinnatti EMS data tell the same story?</p> 
			<p>If not, what can we infer about opioid use patterns from these two distinct datasets? </p>
			<p>How do the waste water findings compare with the EMS data?</p>
			<p>How do the Temp and Cincinnati findings compare? </p>
			<p>Are the same trends prevalent in both data sets? </p>
			<p>If not, what can we infer about citywide or nationwide opioid abuse cofactors?</p>

All entries must have both a strong social theory, political theory or policy perspective and a strong methodology perspective.

						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>These questions are only intended to give a rough idea of what might be an interesting topic to explore for this challenge problem, and by no means the only questions of interest. All entries must have both a strong social theory, political theory or policy perspective and a strong methodology perspective.</p>
			
<!--					<div class="title"><h3>Rules</h3></div>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Participants may work individually or in teams.</li>
							<li>Participants must use at least one of the Tempe data sets and either the Tempe EMS or the Cincinnati Heroin overdose data  <a href="https://insights.cincinnati-oh.gov/stories/s/Heroin/dm3s-ep3u/" target="_blank">https://insights.cincinnati-oh.gov/stories/s/Heroin/dm3s-ep3u/</a></li>
							<li>Participants must use the Tempe Arizona Opioid Crisis data <a href="https://www.govtech.com/health/Tempe-Ariz-Wastewater-Testing-Yields-Opioid-Crisis-Data.html">found here. </a></li>
							<li>Participants should address a <strong>social science theory or policy relevant issue</strong> and should <strong>employ one or more methodologies</strong> appropriate for the empirical assessment of <strong>big data</strong> (e.g., computational algorithms, machine learning, computer simulation, social network analysis, text mining).</li>
							<li>Each participating team may prepare <strong>only one entry.</strong></li>
							<li>Entries must represent <strong>original work</strong> that has not been previously published or submitted to other challenges.</li>
							<li>Each participating team must send <strong> at least one member to the SBP-BRiMS 2022 conference </strong> to present a poster describing their entry on day 2, to do a presentation that is video taped on day 1, and to, if they win, do a presentation on the last day. At least one team member must register and attend the conference. Note if an individual is on two or more teams, that individual can register for only one of the teams, and each of the other teams needs to send a different person.</li>
							<li>Participants may also use an additional data set. This data set must be either publicly available data or the participants must make it publicly available by submitting it along with their challenge paper, prior to the conference.</li>
							<li>Each team must bring a copy of their poster to the conference – these are 4’x5’ or 5’x4’.  Poster boards and easels will be provided. </li>
							<li>At the conference, all entries will be judged by the community using a participant voting system.</li>
							<li>The individual or group that submits the winning entry, and that submitting the runner-up entry, will have their <strong>full length paper describing their challenge solution published in an SBP-BRiMS special issue of the journal Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory.  Submission to the challenge problem means that you consent to publish the fill length paper in this venue.</strong></li>
						</ul>
					</p>
-->
	    
<!--	    
					<div class="title"><h3>Guidelines</h3></div>
					<p>A strong entry will have one or more of these components:</p>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Employ multiple data sets.</li>
							<li>Include a high quality visualization (note that participants will be allowed to display dynamic visualizations via some form of electronic media e.g., by hanging a tablet from the poster. However, <strong>please note that tables will not be provided.</strong></li>
							<li>Account for biases in the data across time, space, topics and sources.</li>
							<li>Provide insight into validity in this domain, and findings related to opiods.</li>
							<li>Generate a new empirical finding that challenges or provides novel support for existing social or political theory, or provides information of policy relevance.  Note, the results of computer simulation are viewed as empirical findings.</li>
						</ul>		
					</p>				
					<p>In addition, a strong entry should be well-written and provide some level of creativity in its use of or combination of data.</p>
