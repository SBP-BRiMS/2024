		<h2>Keynote 2: Patricia Aufderheide, University Professor, School of Communication, American University </h2>
		
		<h3>Title: Public Broadcasting: A Bulwark against Disinformation?</h3>
		
		<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  The “Disinformation Age" (Bennett and Livingston 2021) is a Frankenstein result of several deep and decades-old political currents (Brown 2019). The problem of disinformation brings together media, technology, and democracy. This is as much a political problem as it is a technological one, and the economics of media matter for any redress. While the digital affordances of social media platforms have offered unprecedented amplification and resonance of any messaging, social media activity is typically fueled by analog mass media (Benkler, Faris et al. 2018). While partisan and emotion-soaked messages blast out from organizations such as Sinclair Media and Fox, echoed in social-media platforms, fact-checked reporting and public service media also play an active role in fueling social-media activity. Public broadcasters have the strongest brands commanding public trust in the U.S.: NPR and PBS. Public broadcasters also showcase the work of some of the most trusted media-makers: independent documentarians such as Kartemquin filmmakers (Aufderheide, 2024). In this moment, can public broadcasting be a resource for democratic public-making and civil society?</p>

		<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Patricia Aufderheide is University Professor of Communication Studies in the School of Communication at American University in Washington, D.C. She founded the School's Center for Media & Social Impact, where she continues as Senior Research Fellow. She is also affiliate faculty in the School of International Service and the History department at American University, and a member of the Film and Media Arts division in the School of Communication. Her books include Reclaiming Fair Use: How to Put Balance Back in Copyright (University of Chicago), with Peter Jaszi; Documentary: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford), The Daily Planet (University of Minnesota Press), and Communications Policy in the Public Interest (Guilford Press). She has been a Fulbright Research Fellow twice, in Brazil (1994-5) and Australia (2017). She is also a John Simon Guggenheim fellow (1994) and has served as a juror at the Sundance Film Festival among others. Aufderheide has received numerous journalism and scholarly awards, including the George Stoney award for service to documentary from the University Film and Video Association in 2015, the International Communication Association's 2010 for Communication Research as an Agent of Change Award, Woman of Vision award from Women in Film and Video (DC) in 2010, a career achievement award in 2008 from the International Digital Media and Arts Association and the Scholarship and Preservation Award in 2006 from the International Documentary Association.</p>

		<h2> Dr. Charles “Chick” Macal</h2>
		<h3><small>Chief Scientist at Argonne Resilient Infrastructure Initiative</small> </h3>
		<p>Charles Macal applies computational modeling and simulation tools to complex systems to solve problems in a variety of fields, including energy and national security.He is the chief scientist for the Argonne Resilient Infrastructure Initiative, and is a principal investigator for the development of the widely used Repast agent-based modeling toolkit.He has Appointments at the University of Chicago Computation Institute and the Northwestern-Argonne Institute for Science and Engineering. He is adjunct professor at the University of Chicago, where he teaches a course on Complex Adaptive Systems for Threat Management and Emergency Preparedness.He is a registered professional engineer in the State of Illinois and holds software copyrights for two systems: ELIST (Enhanced Logistics Intra-theater Support Tool) and EMCAS (Electricity Market Complex Adaptive System).

		<h3>Talk title: "Challenges in Modeling the COVID-19 Pandemic and Behavior"</h3>
		<p>Abstract:  It has been nearly 30 years since the first BRIMS meeting and more than a dozen years since the first SBP meeting in 2008. While much has changed since then to advance the field, some things remain disappointingly the same – and need to be addressed. Even so, the future for behavioral-social modeling and simulation (B-S M&S) is quite bright with a multitude of exciting opportunities just around the corner. After briefly reflecting on the progress made in behavioral representation in modeling and simulation, Dr. Mabry will share her thoughts on what recent events tell us about the future of the field, how we can prepare for it, and even shape it. As an interdisciplinary scientist who has spent over a decade of her career leading the systems science program out of the Office of Behavioral and Social Science Research at the (National Institutes of Health), and has been a researcher in small business, academia and a now in a health care system, Dr. Mabry has a unique multidimensional perspective on the value of B-S M&S and its applications. In this talk, she will identify opportunities and caveats for B-S M&S while challenging the audience to engage in self-reflection and critical thinking about how we can collaboratively take on the most pressing problems of our times. Dr. Mabry will share her optimistic vision of the future of B-S M&S and explain how a wide range of influences lead her to this deduction. Those influences include external events such as the rise of Artificial Intelligence, the COVID-19 pandemic, the quest for precision medicine, issues and opportunities in data and technology. She will also explain her passion for using B-S M&S methods to engage in the science of science, the need for cross-disciplinary collaboration, and suggest ways to foster a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion in the field.</p>-->
